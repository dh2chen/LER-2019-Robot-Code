# LER-2019-Robot-Code

Credit to Lake Effect Robotics 2708.

This is the code I helped work on in 2019 for my high school Robotics Team. I helped as part of the programming team to develop the controls and commands to allow our robot
to complete many functionalties such as drive, intake and score orange game balls in order for our robot to compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition.
